# M5_Forecasting
#### In this repository you will see 5 files loaded. Below is the breife of what each file contains:
#### 1. EDA_Overall --> This file has detailed code for performing high level EDA of M5 dataset. Note that EDA was targeted to bring the insights to increase overall sales for the stores.
#### 2. EDA_Sales_Per_Store --> This file has detailed code for performing EDA with respect to store. This EDA deep dives into past performance of each store and try to derive the actions to improve sales for low performing stores.
#### 4. M5_Forecast_Traditional --> This file has detailed code for forecasting sales aggregated at store level using tradictional Machine Learning Methodogies. Here, we will be passing multiple time sereis one by one for prediction. So each prediction is indepedent of other time series history and interaction amongst the time series is missing, if any.
#### 3. M5_Forecast_DL --> Here, time sereis forecasting analysis performed using DeepAR from GluonTS library at product level. LSTM is used for forecasting sales aggregated as store level.

#### Future Scope --> EDA can be enhanced further to understand the effect of exogeneous variables on sales. Appropriate hyperparameter tuning can be used for further enhancement of forecasting models. Bottom level and top level predictions can be made by developing complex models.

#### Closing Note --> All above codes provides great learning opprunity on improving the ability to perform target based EDA. It provides learning on deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting such as DeepAR and LSTM.
